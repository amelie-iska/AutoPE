# AutoProteinEngine (AutoPE)

AutoProteinEngine (AutoPE) is an innovative framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for multimodal automated machine learning (AutoML) in protein engineering tasks. It enables biologists without deep learning backgrounds to interact with deep learning models using natural language, significantly lowering the entry barrier for protein engineering tasks. Our paper is at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04440.

## Overview

AutoPE uniquely integrates:
- LLM-driven model selection for both protein sequence and graph modalities
- Automatic hyperparameter optimization
- Automated data retrieval from protein databases
- Natural language interface for non-experts
